    <h1>Letter to a Filipino penfriend</h1>
    <p class="p1"><b>Dear Ms Nicole, </b></p>
    <p class="p2">How are you? I hope you are doing well. I'm writing to share some exciting news with you. Recently, I've moved to a new school in Ho Chi Minh city.</p>
    <p class="p3">At first, I felt a little nervous because everything was unfamiliar - new teachers, new classmates, and a different learning environtment. However, everyone here is very friendly and supportive, so I'm starting to adapt easily and feel more comfortable.</p>
    <p class='p4'>The school is quite big, with modern classrooms, a library, and even a footbal field. I especially enjoy English and Physical Education classes. I have also made a few new friends, and we often study and play together after school.</p>
    <p class="p5">Although I miss my old school and friends, I'm happy with this new beginning. I believe it will give me many new experiences and opportunities.</p>
    <p class="p6">How about you? How are your teachings going? I'm really looking forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
    <div class="p7">
        Best wishes,<br>
        Phu Vinh
